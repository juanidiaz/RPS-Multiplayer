## DESCRIPTION
This project is an online multiplayer game version of the known rock-paper-scissors game.


## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Create a game that suits this user story:
   * Only two users can play at the same time.

2. Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.
   * The game will track each player's wins and losses.
   * Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.
